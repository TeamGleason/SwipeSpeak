# SwipeSpeak

SwipeSpeak is an iPhone app made to help caregivers communicate with people who
are unable to speak for themselves due to disability, disease, or injury.  It
works similarly to an 'ETran Board' where a person uses their eyes to glance in
a direction and this corresponds to a letter of the alphabet.

What SwipeSpeak brings to the table is word prediction to make it easier to say
words with fewer eye gestures.
