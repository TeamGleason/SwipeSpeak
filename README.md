# SwipeSpeak

SwipeSpeak is an iPhone app made to help caregivers communicate with people who
are unable to speak for themselves due to disability, disease, or injury.  It
works similarly to an 'ETran Board' where a person uses their eyes to glance in
a direction and this corresponds to a letter of the alphabet.

What SwipeSpeak brings to the table is word prediction to make it easier to say
words with fewer eye gestures.

# Functionality

SwipeSpeak allows you to select from a few different layouts for making eye
gestures:

For example, a commonly used system is the 'ETran Board' which uses two eye
gestures to choose a letter.  First you look in one of six directions to choose
a box of letters, then you look again to choose a letter within the box.

By combining guestures with word prediction, we can figure out what word you mean
if you choose the group of letters the word belongs to.  This allows us to select
the letter you intend by combining the letter group with a dictionary of possible
words.
