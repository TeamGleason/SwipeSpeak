  <h1>About SwipeSpeak</h1>

  <p>SwipeSpeak is an app that allows people to communicate with eye gestures.
Serving as a communication board (similar to an E-Tran Board), SwipeSpeak displays a keyboard which allows a communication partner to construct words and sentences.</p>

  <p>A communication partner reads eye gestures of a speaker and swipes in the corresponding direction on the app's screen. SwipeSpeak will then translate those swipes into words and sentences.</p>

  <p>SwipeSpeak also implements a predictive text engine to find all possible words that could be created with the letters in a groups indicated by a gesture sequence. To enter one character, a speaker will move his eyes in the direction associated with that letter’s group, and the communication partner will swipes in the corresponding direction on the app's screen.</p>

  <p>

  <ul>
    <li>Multiple keyboard layouts</li>
